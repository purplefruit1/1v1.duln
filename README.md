# 1v1.duln
A easy to follow 1v1.LOL reward duper, which relies on the current seasons battlepass.  Comes with the dulncheck py script to automatically check if you can dupe. Install it from the releases tab.

1v1.duln (Duping Vulnerability) relies on utilising an exploit between cross platform progression data. The exploit is completely safe with 0 risk of getting banned for it, and in the current season allows for 210 gems per minute if done fast enough.

# Requirements
A dupeable version of the game (find out with dulncheck, installable from the releases tab!)

A PC running Windows, Mac or Linux with the Steam version of 1v1.LOL and an IPhone or IPad running any version (cfw, altstore, etc do NOT effect this method, so it does not matter if it is installed or not) that has the latest version of 1v1.LOL installed.

You MUST have LOL+ (monthly or weekly) on an iOS or iPadOS. There is no way around this.

Must be level 30+ on the pass, but do not reach level 40. Level 39 is as far as this method was tested.

# How it works
1v1.duln works by exploiting the cross platform progression data in 1v1.LOL. Once you reach level 30, all devices not running apple firmware will have reached the max level. However, on IOS versions of the game, the max level becomes 40 (along with gem rewards being rapidly increased). Once you are level 30, you must continue progression to level 39 (or whatever level you want to receive rewards from) on an IOS device by either progressing manually or purchasing tiers for gems.

# How to activate the exploit
1. Launch into 1v1.lol on any non apple device.
2. Wait until the loading bar reaches 60% (or you see downloading assets) and force quit the game. (Alt + F4, etc)
3. Now launch the game on any apple device.
4. Claim battlepass rewards 31-39 (or whatever your max 30+ tier is)
5. Quit 1v1.lol
6. Repeat, the tiers should become unclaimed upon re-reaching step 4!
